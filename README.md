MultiTwitch Minimal

This is a personal project to create an HTML file with JS code to generate multiple streams with minimal size, memory, and quality.

TwitchStreams.html is the working version. TwitchStreamsTest.html is the testing versions, any code testing/changes done are done here first before copied over into twitchStreams.html.

--------------------------

To run:
1. Copy the repository and place somewhere on the computer.
2. open terminal/cmd and cd into the repository until in the location where html files are located
```
  cd  {location where repository is saved}/TwitchMinEmbed
```
3. (Requires python3) Run the following command to open a local server
 ```
python3 -m http.server
``` 
4. Open a browser tab and open the link http://localhost:8000/
5. Select the file you wish to view and test.
